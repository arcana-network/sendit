            Don’t explain crypto, show them the convenience. Just send them some
            crypto using SendIt!

          <h4>People are scared they’ll make mistakes with wallet addresses</h4>
          <p>
            With SendIt, people can send money just using email addresses. What
            could be simpler?

          <h4>The Crypto learning curve scares people</h4>
          <p>
            With SendIt, a self-custodial wallet is created which can be
            accessed with Web2 authentication. Users can learn crypto-specific
            ideas at their own pace.

          <h4>Metamask is difficult to navigate</h4>
          <p>
            Metamask is good for technically inclined users, mainstream adoption
            requires the use of Web2 concepts that are already familiar to
            users. SendIt does that.
